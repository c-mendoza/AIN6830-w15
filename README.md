# AIN6830-w15
Repository for AIN 6830 - Winter 15 - Wayne State University

This repository is meant to keep you, the AIN 6830 student, up to date with the latest code we've written in class. Exercise files and most completed demos will still be found in the class blog.

The repo has only one folder for the moment, in-class-code, which includes all of the code that I've written with you in class. Whenever you fall behind in class, let me know and I'll sync my code with the repository, making the latest changes available to you.
